Welcome to my blog! I go by **moshyfawn** on the Internet and I am a software engineer with a passion for creating and building innovative solutions. On this blog, I will be sharing my experiences and insights as a developer, as well as showcasing the projects and technologies that I am currently working on.

I am particularly interested in using technology to improve the lives of communities and individuals, and I am currently focusing on two projects that I believe have the potential to make a real difference: [SmartONE solutions](https://smart-one.ca/) and [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/). SmartONE is a company that is dedicated to improving the functionality and efficiency of living communities, while React Hook Form is a tool that simplifies the process of creating complex forms with [React](https://beta.reactjs.org/).

If you are interested in staying up to date with my work and my thoughts on the world of technology, consider subscribing to my [RSS feed](https://www.moshyfawn.dev/rss.xml) or following me on Twitter [@moshyfawn](https://twitter.com/moshyfawn).

Thank you for reading my first blog post and I look forward to connecting with you through my writing or on twitter.
